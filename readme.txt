SVM(Support Vector Machine) FINAL PROJECT

Simple implementation of a Support Vector Machine using the
 Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm for training.
There is a dataset which is applicable directly with this code. While using the same data format you can change dataset.
SVM.py is the main code. Support Vector Machine is here.
SVMtest.py is used for reading the file, in this project data is banknotes.

#Remaining 80% to training set
    
#Splits 20% data to test set
